Ditto is an open source virtual machine which aims to bring sanity to the world of app and platform development. Ditto is designed to emulate an actual machine, and thus has its own complete instruction set. It even supports protected mode. In order to get the greatest efficiency out of the Ditto instruction set, the entire core of the Virtual Machine is written directly in platform-specific assembly language, which allows the software to avoid the memory/stack overhead of C function structures and calling conventions, as well as allowing us to get the most out of a native CPU's instruction pipeline and register set. Only the most clock cycle efficient instructions are used (unless, of course, we can't use them). Since the Ditto instruction set architecture is designed to be a full instruction set, the system has its own assembler. With this assembler, we aim to build a full compiler development SDK. This SDK would provide a framework for developers to create compilers for any language of their choosing.

The Ditto Virtual Machine will also be small enough
